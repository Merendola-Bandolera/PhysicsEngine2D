PROJECT SUMMARY:
-This is an atempt to recreate the game series "Worms", are turn-based artillery games presented in 2D or 3D environment. 
Each player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their 
worms. They use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the 
game.
This attempt is being done by using our own physics engine.
You can change between the various methods (Implicit Euler, Symplectic Euler, Velocity-Verlet, Runge-Kutta)
to calculate the trajectory of the bullet (see controls).
The background landscape is not original content. However the cannon, the wheel and the bomb were made by us.

CONTROLS:
-A-D keys to control the angle of the shot
-SPACE key to jump
-F keyto shoot
-Left and Right arrows to move
-G key to cap frames to 60fps
-Key 1 Implicit Euler
-Key 2 Symplectic Euler
-Key 3 Velocity-Verlet
-Key 4 Runge-Kutta (still needs to be implemented)
